# Example of a cluster node table for the CMM emulator
#

# The format is :
# nodeid cluster_name unix_hostname <MEN or NMEN>

# BEWARE ! The node id has to be the last byte of the IP address of the
# node
#
# AND the node ids must be consecutive numbers starting at 101

101 node1       10.1.1.101      MEN
102 node2       10.1.1.102      MEN
103 node3       10.1.1.103      MEN
